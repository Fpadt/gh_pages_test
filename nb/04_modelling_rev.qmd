6.1. Literature Review / Similar Models - comprehensive overview of the state of the art in machine learning, including the latest algorithms, - insight into the performance of different algorithms and techniques on similar types of data. (avoid wasting time on models that are unlikely to perform well.)

### Model Selection

different models have different strengths and weaknesses and are suitable for different types of data and problems. achieve the best possible performance and maximize the impact

avoid overfitting a trade-off between the simplicity and flexibility (robustness)

model performance - only article hierarchy - article and customer hierarchy

Cross-validation is a method for evaluating the performance of a model on a validation dataset. This involves dividing the data into k folds, training the model on k-1 folds, and evaluating the performance on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once, and the results are averaged to obtain a final performance score. This method provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance, as it uses all of the data for training and evaluation.

## Literature {#sec-literature_review}

The literature review focuses on the intersection of three fields, according to the now-ubiquitous Data Science Venn Diagram of [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram).

## EAISI {#sec-eaisi}

### [Deliverables & requirements](https://academy.eaisi.nl/l/41851394)

-   Clear description of the need / problem / opportunity
-   Clear description of the long-term ambition
-   Clear focus on what part of this long-term ambition will be taken on in the project
-   Description of the data science project with the help of a flowdown chart and project charter
-   Clear description of how the model outcome / analysis results will be used (e.g. who, at what time, in which process, in what way, will use the model outcome / analysis results to make a better decision about what?) and how this translates into improved KPIs as outlined in the flowdown chart
-   Substantiated choice for a ‘performance metric’ (i.e. what should the model be good at)
-   Clear description of a business case / cost-benefit (no cost!!) analysis
-   Realistic plan / timeline for how to execute the consecutive CRISP-DM phases
